\section{LGPL licensed software}

Both versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License explicitly distinguish
the distribution of the source code from that of the binaries: On the one hand,
the LGPL-2.1 mainly talks about copying and distributing the source
code\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §1, §2, §5, §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. But it
also directly mentions the specific conditions for \enquote{[\ldots] (copying)
and (distributing) the Library [\ldots] in object code or executable form
[\ldots]}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §4]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. On the other
hand, also the LGPL-3.0 and the GPL-3.0 -- which have to be considered together
because the GPL-3.0 is included into the LGPL-3.0\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp, just
before §0]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a} -- are treating the distribution of source
code and the distribution of the object code as different aspects of the same
phenomenon\footnote{The GPL-3.0 contains a specific section named
\enquote{Conveying Non-Source Forms} which describes the conditions to
\enquote{[\ldots] convey a covered work in object code form [\ldots]}
(\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §6]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a})), while the LGPL-3.0
explicitly deals with the \enquote{object code incorporating material from (the)
library header files}(\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a})).}.
Additionally, LGPL-2.1 and LGPL-3.0 mainly talk about copying and distribution
the software; the private use is nearly complete unspecified\footnote{The
LGPL-2.1 lists its 'restrictions' only with respect to the act of copying and
distributing \enquote{copies of the library} (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §1, §2, §4
et passim]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}) while the GPL-3.0 explicitly specifies that
one \enquote{[\ldots] may make, run and propagate covered works that (one does)
not convey, without conditions so long as (the) license otherwise remains in
force} (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}).}. Finally, the
LGPL-2.1 and the LGPL-3.0 are aiming for the same results and the same spirit by
requiring nearly the same license fulfilling tasks. Therefore it is mostly
appropriate to cover both versions in one chapter\footnote{The exception
concerns the distribution of a modified program, application, or server under
the terms of the LGPL} and to offer the same LGPL specific open source use
case structure\footnote{For details of the general OSUC finder $\rightarrow$

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}

\begin{itemize}
  
  \item The LGPL-2.1 allows to \enquote{[\ldots] to copy \emph{and} (to)
  distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you
  receive it [...] provided that you [a] conspicuously and appropriately publish
  on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; [b]
  keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of
  any warranty; and [c] distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §1, emphasizes by
  KR]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. Additionally, the LGPL-2.1 allows the distribution
  of the modfied source code \enquote{under the terms of Section
  1}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a} and the distribution
  of binaries \enquote{under the terms of Sections 1 and
  2}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §4]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. But the LGPL does
  not require any tasks if you are using the work only for yourself. Thus, the
  quoted conditions of \enquote{Section 1} are mandatory for all use cases
  concerning the distribution of an LGPL licensed work (LGPL-2 -
  LGPL-9)\footnote{The GPL-3.0, which is included into the LGPL-3.0, uses a
  similar structure to establish the same requirements ($\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.\
  \pageref{Gpl3ConditionsDistri}). Based on this fact one may conclude that the
  tasks which fulfill the corresponding LGPL-2.1 requirements together also fit
  the GPL-3.0 conditions and hence those of the LGPL-3.0.}.

  \item Although both versions of the LGPL does not explicitly require to retain
  the copyright notices in the form you have received them, it is nevertheless a
  very good idea not to modify these elements (LGPL-2 - LGPL-9).
  
  \item The LGPL-2.1 allows to \enquote{[\ldots] copy and (to) distribute the
  Library (or a portion or derivative of it [\ldots]) in object code or
  executable form u[\ldots] provided that you accompany it with the complete
  corresponding machine-readable source code [\ldots] on a medium customarily
  used for software interchange}. And the license subspecifies this condition in
  the meaning that if one makes the object code accessible without distributing
  it directly, then the same 'download' method for the source code fulfills this
  condition\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §4]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. So, no doubt:
  in a very strict reading, the LGPL requires to distribute the source code and
  the object code together and by the same method: either both on (for example)
  DVD or both for being downloaded; but not the one on DVD and the other by a
  download repository. But the first specification also says, that the
  \enquote{complete corresponding machine readable source code} has to be
  distributed \enquote{on a medium customarily used for software
  interchange}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §4]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. The OSLiC
  understands the possibility to download files from the internet as a
  distribution \emph{on a medium [being today] customarily used for software
  interchange}. Therefore, the OSLiC requires for all open source use cases
  which refer to the distribution of binaries (LGPL-3, LGPL-5, LGPL-7, LGPL-9)
  to make the source code of the corresponding library accessible via an
  internet repository\footnote{In opposite to the LGPL-2.1, the GPL-3.0, which
  is included into the LGPL-3.0, explictily offers the option to distribute the
  sources via an internet server ($\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.\
  \pageref{Gpl3CondCopyleft}). So, one may again conclude that the tasks
  which fulfill the corresponding LGPL-2.1 requirements together also fit the
  GPL-3.0 and the LGPL-3.0 conditions.}.
  
  \item The LGPL allows to \enquote{[\ldots] modify your copy or copies of
  the Library or any portion of it [\ldots] and (to) copy and distribute such
  modifications [\ldots]} only under some restrictions and
  condtions\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First, modified files must be marked as modifications and marked by
    the date of the modification\footnote{For LGPL-2.1 see \cite[cf.][\nopage
    wp.\ §2]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. For GPL-3.0 (being included into the
    LGPL-3.0) see \cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §5]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}}. This
    condition must be respected by all open source use cases concerning the
    distribution of the modified work [LGPL-4 - LGPL -9], because even if one
    primarily intends to distribute binaries, one has also to deliver the source
    code. The OSLiC 'replaces' this requirement by the mandatory condition to
    mark each modified file and by the voluntary condition to update / generate
    a general changing file.
    
    \item Second, it requires not to let the modified version depend on external
    data structures without \enquote{[\ldots] (making) a good faith effort to
    ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
    purpose remains meaningful}\footnote{For LGPL-2.1 see \cite[cf.][\nopage
    wp.\ §2d]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. For LGPL-3.0 see \cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
    §2a]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a}}. The OSLiC rewrites this condition as the
    obligation to maintain the structural independence of the library in case of
    using the modified library as embedded component [LGPL-8 - LGPL-9].
    
    \item \label{para:libislib}Third, the LGPL-2.1 definitely requires, that
    \enquote{the modified work must itself be a software
    library}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. This
    conditions can directly be incorprated as an interdiction into all use cases
    which refer to the modification of a library [LGPL-6 - LGPL-9]. But is
    difficult to respect this condition if one wants to modify a program which
    one has received under the terms of the LGPL-2.1. Logically, one can write
    an application and license it under the LGPL. But - as a consequence - that
    impedes the modification of this work because the result must be a library.
    The LGPL-3.0 does not contain such a requirement. Hence, the OSLiC allows
    the distribution of modified programs (LGPL-4, LGPL5) only if they are
    licensed under the terms of LGPL-3.0{as long as nobody has shown us an exit
    out of this trap.}.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Additionally, the LGPL-2.1 allows the licensee to distribute an
  overarching on-top development -- in the wording of the LGPL-2.1: a
  \enquote{work that uses the libary} \footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §5,
  §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a} -- \enquote{as an exception to the Sections above}
  in \enquote{combination} with the library \enquote{under terms of your
  choice}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}, provided that
  the licensee fulfills additional conditions:  First, it must clearly be stated
  that the on-top development depends on the (modified) library. Second, the
  LGPL must be added into the distributed package. Third, in its own copyright
  dialog, the on-top development must mention the library, its copyright holder,
  and that it is licensed under the LGPL\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. In the LGPL-3.0, this condition is similarily
  integrated: On the one hand, the \enquote{combined work} is defined as
  \enquote{a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the
  Library}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §0]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a}. On the other
  hand, the LGPL-3.0 states that one \enquote{[\ldots] may convey a Combined
  Work under terms of (his own) choice} provided that one [a] clearly says that
  the overarching on-top development uses the LGPL licensed library, [b]
  distributes the LGPL-3.0 and the GPL-3.0 license as part of the package, [c]
  displays all these (licensing) information by the existing display
  technologies, [d] requires an appropriate shared library mechanism, and [e]
  offers the respectiv installion information\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §4]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a}. These requirements can directly be inserted as
  conditions into the respective use cases -- namely for both LGPL versions
  (LGPL-8, LGPL-9).
  
  \item The most difficult requirements of the LGPL-2.1 concern the distribution
  in the form of binaries. In a very strict reading, the LGPL does not require
  to link the on-top development and the libary only dynamically. At first, the
  LGPL mentions, that the \enquote{[..] work (that uses the Library), in
  isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library [\ldots]}. But if it is
  linked to the library the resulting executable program -- of course -- becomes
  \enquote{a derivative of the Library} and that it is therefore
  \enquote{[\ldots] covered by this License (LGPL-2.1)}. But the LGPL-2.1
  directly continues this statement with the hint, that \enquote{Section 6
  states terms for distribution of such executables}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §5]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. Finally, this section 6 directly starts with
  statement: \enquote{As an exception to the Sections above, you may also
  combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
  of your choice}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}.
  
  This is important to know, because until this section 6 one can not directly
  read or indirectly infer that the LGPL-2.1 distinguished the act of
  dynamically linking a program and a lirbrary from that of statically linking
  these parts. The LGPL only wants to ensure that the binaries of the library
  itself can be replaced by a newer version. And that is required by section
  6\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}.
  From a technically viewpoint, this can only be guaranteed, if the binaries of
  the on-top development and the library together are \enquote{used in a
  suitable shared library mechanism}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a} or if one also gets all compiled, but not linked
  object-files of the on-top development and the library, either directly, or
  via using a \enquote{a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
  the same user the (respective) materials}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. In the first case, the user can replace the
  received version of the library and can let the application be relinked
  automatically. In the second case, he has to do it manually. It is important
  to know that these ways exist if one wants or must distribute statically
  linked works. The LGPL-2.1 does not forbid to distribute statically linked
  applications. But it requires to enable the receiver to relink the work.
  
  The LGPL-3.0 has reduced these complex conditions in a special way: First, it
  does not use the words 'statically linked' or 'dynamically' linked. Second it
  defines the combined work 'only' as the result of \enquote{combining or
  linking an Application with the Library}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §0]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a}. But then it requires for the distribution of the
  combined works that one has either to \enquote{convey the Minimal
  Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding
  Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user
  to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked
  Version to produce a modified Combined Work [\ldots]} or that one must
  presuppose that the receiver uses \enquote{[\ldots] suitable shared library
  mechanism for linking with the Library [\ldots] that [\ldots] operate properly
  with a modified version of the Library [\ldots]}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §4]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a}. Finally, the LGPL-3.0 adds that in the first case
  the these materials which enables the relinking must be distributed
  \enquote{[\ldots] in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL[-3.0]
  for conveying Corresponding Source}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §4]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a}. And this section 6 of the GPL-3.0 allows the well
  known method to \enquote{convey the object code [\ldots] accompanied by a
  written offer [\ldots] to give anyone [\ldots] access to copy the
  Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge}\footcite[cf.][\nopage
  wp.\ §6]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}

  Therefore, the OSLiC can condense these conditions into the requirement,
  either to distribute dynamically linkable parts, or to distribute statically
  linked applications \enquote{(accompanied) [\ldots] with a written offer,
  valid for at least three years, to give the same user the [complete]
  materials}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}, so that he
  can relink the application on its own behalf. It is clear, that this condition
  is only valid for the use case LGPL-9.
  
\end{itemize}
