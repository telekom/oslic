\section{EPL licensed software}

The Eclipse Public License clearly distinguishes the distribution in the form of
source code from that in the form of binaries: It allows to \enquote{distribute}
Eclipse licensed programs \enquote{in source code and in object
code}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a} before it specifies
under which conditions one may distribute the program as a set of binaries.
\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3 top area]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}. One of these
conditions is -- roughly spoken -- that the distributor makes the sources
available too\footnote{\cite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3 mid
area]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}. More precisely, the EPL has to be taken as a
license with weak copyleft ($\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.\
\pageref{sec:ProtectingPowerOfEpl})}. The other conditions refer to the
distribution in general -- no matter what form or state is
used\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3 bottom area]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}. So, taken
as whole, the EPL mainly focusses on the distribution of a program. Thus, for
finding the simply processable task lists, the following EPL specific open source
use case structure\footnote{For details of the general OSUC finder $\rightarrow$

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}

The EPL offers a simply structured section
\enquote{Requirements}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}
completed by some definitions concerning a \enquote{Commercial
Distribution}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §4]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}: First it
describes, what a distributor must do who wants to distribute an Eclipse
licensed program as set of binaries. Then it describes, what must be done for
compliantly distributing it as source code. Finally it lists two conditions
which must be fulfilled in any case\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\
§3]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}. With respect to this structure, we can detect the
following tasks:

\begin{itemize}

  \item The EPL generally requires that \enquote{Contributors may not remove or
  alter any copyright notices contained within the
  Program}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a} whereas -- on the
  one hand -- the word 'Contributor' has to be read as \enquote{any person or
  entity that distributes the Program}, and -- on the other hand -- the word
  'Program' denotes the \enquote{initial contribution} and all its
  modifications\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §1]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}. Similar to
  the EUPL, also the EPL does not limit this requirement to the cases of
  'distributing' the software (\emph{4others}), at least in a very strict
  reading. But -- in the cases of not distributing the software -- the control
  of a license compliant use could be difficult without automatically switching
  into the use case class 'distributing'. But in opposite to -- for example --
  the EUPL, the EPL contains an interdiction. Nevertheless, the OSLiC not only
  respects this interdiction, but also rewrites this negative condition as
  positive assertion because it is important to actively control that the
  existing copyright notes retain in exact the form one hase received them.
  Thus, the OSLiC only inserts this activity as a mandatory clause for the
  \emph{4others} use cases (EPL-2 - EPL-9).
  
  \item Furthermore, the EPL requires that \enquote{each Contributor must
  identify itself as the originator of its Contributions [\ldots] in a manner
  that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the
  Contribution}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}, In this
  case 'Contribution' has to be read as the \enquote{initial code and
  documention} together with all subsequent modifications of these
  parts\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §1]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}. For fulfilling this
  condition faithfully, a developer must mark and describe his modifications of
  a source code within this source code; and the distributor must describe these
  modifications on the more general level of software features in a file
  sometimes called CHANGES. On a first glance, the requirement to document the
  source code modifications within the source code seems to be restricted to the
  use cases which concern the distribution of a modified EPL software in the
  form of source code. But the EPL allows the distribution in the form of
  binaries only if the distributor also states where one can otain the
  correspoding code\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}. So,
  distributing the binaries implies the distribution of the source code.
  Therefore the OSLiC inserts the two requirements as mandatory clauses into all
  the use cases concerning the distribution of a modified EPL software (EPL-4 -
  EPL-9).
  
  \item For all distributions in the form of source code, the EPL requires that
  the software \enquote{8\ldots] must be made available under this (Eclipse
  Public License 1.0) Agreement} and that \enquote{[\ldots] a copy of this
  Agreement must be included with each copy of the
  Program}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3]{Epl10OsiLicense2005a}. Thus, the OSLiC
