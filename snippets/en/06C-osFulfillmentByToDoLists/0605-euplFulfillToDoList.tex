\section{EUPL licensed software}
\begin{license}{EUPL} % ends at end of file
\licensename{EUPL-1.1}
\licensespec{European Union Public License 1.1}
\licenseversion{1.1}
\licenseabbrev{EUPL}

The European Union Public License explicitly distinguishes the distribution of
the source code from that of the binaries: In the chapter \enquote{Communication
of the Source Code,} it allows to \enquote{provide the Work either in its Source
Code form, or as Executable Code.}\citeEUPL{§3} But if a piece of EUPL licensed
software is distributed as binary package, then the license additionally
requires that the distributor either \enquote{[\ldots] provides a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code [\ldots]} directly together with the
binaries\citeEUPL{§5} or that he \enquote{[\ldots] indicates [\ldots] a
repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as
the Licensor continues to distribute [\ldots] the Work.}\citeEUPL{§3} For
respecting this conditions it is irrelevant whether the software has been 
modified or not and all the other \enquote{obligations of the licensee} refer
to both forms.\citeEUPL{§5}

But there is a specific aspect which has to be considered for acting in
accordance to the EUPL: Taken literally, the EUPL is a license with a weak
copyleft, no doubt. But this happens only a result of the fact that the EUPL
allows the licensee to relicense the software by following the conditions of a
specific clause and an licenses listed in an appendix, which also includes some
licenses with a weak copyleft.%
  \footnote{($\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.\ \protectionpageref{EUPL})} 
Thus, with respect to question how to fulfill the license best, it is safer to
treat the EUPL as a license with a default strong copyleft. Concerning the use
of an unmodified or a modified library as an embedded component, a license with
a strong copy left implies that also the application which is using the
(un)modified library has to be licensed under the same conditions as the library 
itself. Thus, for finding the simply processable task lists, the following EUPL
specific and a little more sophisticated open source use case structure%

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}
\begin{itemize}
  
\item The EUPL generally \enquote{[\ldots] does not grant permission to use
  the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except
  as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
  Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.}\citeEUPL{§5} 
  Therefore, the OSLiC genreally interdicts (EUPL-C1 -- EUPL-CB) to promote any
  service or product based on this software by such elements. 

\item The EUPL generally requires that \enquote{[\ldots] the Licensee shall
  keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that
  refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties.}\citeEUPL{§5} 
  In a very strict reading, the EUPL does not limit this requirement to the
  distribution of the software. But in practise, it will be impossible to
  control the compliant use of the software in those cases (\emph{4yourself})
  without `switching' into the use case `distribution.' Therefore the OSLiC only
  inserts this requirement as a mandatory clause for the \emph{2others} use
  cases (EUPL-C2 -- EUPL-CB). 
  
\item The EUPL also requires to \enquote{[\ldots] include [\ldots] a copy of
  the (EUPL) Licence with every (distributed) copy of the Work}.\citeEUPL{§5}
  Therefore, all \emph{2others} use cases contain the respective mandatory
  condition (EUPL-C2 -- EUPL-CB).
  
\item Additionally, the EUPL requires that the \enquote{licensee} who
  distributes a modified work \enquote{[\ldots] must cause any Derivative Work 
  to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the
  date of modification.}\citeEUPL{§5} 
  Thus, the OSLiC integrates the mandatory requirement to generate (update) a
  respective notice file into all `modification' use cases and recommends to mark
  all modifications in the source code (EUPL-C6 -- EUPL-CB).
  
\item Furthermore, the EUPL requires that any distributor of the software
  \enquote{[\ldots] provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code [\ldots]}
  by \enquote{[\ldots] (indicating) a repository where this Source will be
  easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to
  distribute [\ldots] the Work.}%
  \footnote{\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §5]{EuplLicense2007en}. To be precise, the
    EUPL also allows to directly distribute the source code together with the
    binary packages (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3]{EuplLicense2007en}). With
    respect to the OSLiC principle to offer only one reliable way, the OSLiC
    simplifies this option: It `only' asks for the repository solution.} 
  Therefore the OSLiC inserts a respective requirement into the task list of all
  cases concerning a binary distribution (EUPL-C3, EUPL-C7, EUPL-C9, and EUPL-CB)
  
\item Finally, the EUPL contains a \enquote{copyleft clause} stating that if a
  \enquote{[\ldots] Licensee distributes [\ldots] copies of the Original Works
  or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution [...] will
  be done under the terms of this (EUPL) Licence [\ldots]}. In all the use cases
  which do not concern the use of an embedded component (EUPL-C2 -- EUPL-C9) this
  copyleft clause is already fulfilled by either distributing the modified
  sources themselves or by making them accessible via a repository. In those
  cases where the licensee distributes an program that uses an embedded EUPL
  licensed component (EUPL-CA -- EUPL-CB), in general, the code of the embedding
  program must also be distributed. Thus, with respect to the use case (EUPL-CA)
  this is already fulfilled by definition. So, the OSLiC only mentions this
  default view in the case EUPL-CB and therefore implicitly evokes a strong
  copyleft effect of the EUPL.%
  \footnote{Formally, the EUPL-1.1 is a license with weak copyleft. But this is
    only a result of the allowance to relicense the software ($\rightarrow$
    OSLiC, p.\ \protectionpageref{EUPL}). So, as long as you do not relicense
    the embedded library with respect to the list of 
    \enquote{compatible licenses according to article 5 EUPL}, you also have to
    publish the code of your overarching work. Therefore, you can only avoid
    this consequence by relicensing the embedded component by one of the
    compatible licenses with a weak copyleft listed in the EUPL appendix
    (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp §5 and Appendix]{EuplLicense2007en})}
