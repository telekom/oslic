\section{MIT licensed software}

The MIT license is known as one of the most permissive licenses. Thus, the
MIT specific finder can be simplified:

\label{OSUC-01-MIT} 
\label{OSUC-03-MIT} 
\label{OSUC-06-MIT}
\label{OSUC-09-MIT}
  
\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to use a received MIT software only for yourself
and that you do not hand it over to any 3rd party in any sense.
\item[covers] OSUC-01, OSUC-03, OSUC-06, and OSUC-09\footnote{For details $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\
  \pageref{OSUC-01-DEF} - \pageref{OSUC-09-DEF}}
\item[requires] the following tasks in order to fulfill the conditions
    of the MIT license:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item You are allowed to use any kind of MIT licensed software in any sense
    and in any context without any other obligations if you do not handover the
    software to 3rd parties and if you do not modify the existing copyright
    notes and the existing permission notice.
  \end{itemize}
\item[prohibits] nothing explicitly.
\end{description}

\subsection{MIT-2: Passing the unmodified software}
\label{OSUC-02S-MIT} \label{OSUC-05S-MIT} \label{OSUC-07S-MIT} 
\label{OSUC-02B-MIT} \label{OSUC-05B-MIT} \label{OSUC-07B-MIT} 

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to distribute an unmodified version of the
received MIT software to 3rd parties -- in the form of binaries or as source
code files. In this case it also doesn't matter whether you distribute a
program, an application, a server, a snippet, a module, a library, or a plugin
as an independent package.

\item[covers] OSUC-02S,  OSUC-02B, OSUC-05S, OSUC-05B, OSUC-07S,
OSUC-07B\footnote{For details $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\
\pageref{OSUC-02S-DEF} - \pageref{OSUC-07B-DEF}}

\item[requires] the following tasks in order to fulfill the license conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the licensing elements -- esp.\
  the MIT license text containing the specific copyright notices of the original
  author(s), the permission notices and the MIT disclaimer -- are retained in
  your package in the form you have received them.
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} It's a good tradition to let the documentation of
  your distribution and/or your additional material also contain a link to the
  original software (project) and its homepage.
\end{itemize}
\item[prohibits] nothing explicitly.
\end{description}

\subsection{MIT-3: Passing a modified program}
\label{OSUC-04S-MIT} \label{OSUC-04B-MIT}

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to distribute a modified version of the received
MIT program, application, or server (proapse) to 3rd parties --  in the form of
binaries or as source code files.
\item[covers] OSUC-04S, OSUC-04B\footnote{For details $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\
\pageref{OSUC-04S-DEF}}
\item[requires] the following tasks in order to fulfill the license conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the original licensing elements -- esp.\
  the MIT license text containing the specific copyright notices of the original
  author(s), the permission notices and the MIT disclaimer -- are retained in
  your package in the form you have received them.
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Mark your modifications in the source code,
  whether or not you want to distribute the code.
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} It's a good tradition to let the documentation of
  your distribution and/or your additional material also contain a link to the
  original software (project) and its homepage.
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} You can expand an existing copyright notice
  presented by the program with information about your own work or
  modifications.
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} It is a good practice of the open source
  community, to let the copyright notice which is shown by the program also
  state that it is based on a version originally licensed under the MIT license.
  Because you are already modifying the program, you can also add such a hint,
  if the presented original copyright notice lacks such a statement.
\end{itemize}
\item[prohibits] nothing explicitly.
\end{description}

\subsection{MIT-4: Passing a modified library independently}
\label{OSUC-08S-MIT}\label{OSUC-08B-MIT}
\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to distribute a modified version of the received
MIT code snippet, module, library, or plugin (snimoli) to 3rd parties -- in the
form of binaries or as source code files. But you do not embed it into another
larger software unit.

\item[covers] OSUC-08S, OSUC-08B\footnote{For details $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\
\pageref{OSUC-08S-DEF}}
\item[requires] the following tasks in order to fulfill the license conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the original licensing elements -- esp.\
  the MIT license text containing the specific copyright notices of the original
  author(s), the permission notices and the MIT disclaimer -- are retained in
  your package in the form you have received them.
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Mark your modifications in the source code,
  whether or not you want to distribute the code.
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} It's a good tradition to let the documentation of
  your distribution and/or your additional material also contain a link to the
  original software (project) and its homepage.
\end{itemize}
\item[prohibits] nothing explicitly.
\end{description}


\subsection{MIT-5: Passing a modified library as embedded component}
\label{OSUC-10S-MIT}\label{OSUC-10B-MIT}
\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to distribute a modified version of the received
MIT code snippet, module, library, or plugin (snimoli) to 3rd parties together
with another larger software unit which contains this code snippet, module,
library, or plugin as an embedded component -- regardless whether you distribute
it in the form of binaries or as source code files.

\item[covers] OSUC-10S, OSUC-10B\footnote{For details $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\
\pageref{OSUC-10S-DEF}}
\item[requires] the following tasks in order to fulfill the license conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the original licensing elements -- esp.\
  the MIT license text containing the specific copyright notices of the original
  author(s), the permission notices and the MIT disclaimer -- are retained in
  your package in the form you have received them.
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Mark your modifications in the source code,
  whether or not you want to distribute the code.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} It is a good practice of the open source
  community, to let the copyright notice which is shown by the running program
  also state that the program uses a component being licensed under the MIT
  license. And it is a good tradition to insert links to the homepage / download
  page of this used component.

  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} It's also a good tradition to let the
  documentation of your program and/or your additional material also mention
  that you have used this component added by a link to the original software
  component and its homepage.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Arrange your distribution so that the the original
  licensing elements -- esp.\ the MIT license text containing the specific
  copyright notices of the original author(s), the permission notices and the
  MIT disclaimer --  clearly refer only to the embedded library and do not
  disturb the licensing of your own overarching work. It's a good tradition to
  keep the libraries, modules, snippet, or plugins in specific directories which
  contain also all licensing elements.
  
\end{itemize}
\item[prohibits] nothing explicitly.
\end{description}

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}

The MIT-License is known as one of the most permissive licenses. It is a very
short license containing (0) a copyright notice, (1) a paragraph saying that you
are allowed to do almost anything you want, followed (2) by the condition that
you have to \enquote{include} the existing copyright notes and the permission
notes \enquote{[\ldots] in all copies or substantial portions of the software},
and (3) closed by the well known disclaimer\footcite[cf.][\nopage
wp]{MitLicense2012a}. But the license doesn't talk about the difference of
source code and object code. So, you have to find the right way by yourself.
Here are our readings:

\label{sec:MitDiscussions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If you do not modify the received MIT licensed application, neither for
  your own purposes, nor for handing over the program to 3rd parties, you can
  conclude that all copyright notices and permission notices are already
  correct.
  \item Nevertheless, we added the hint not to modify these licensing elements
  in the context of the use case \emph{used by yourself}. This is evoked by the
  MIT license itself. It requires explicitly that \enquote{ the above copyright
  notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or
  substantial portions of the Software}\footcite[cf.][\nopage
  wp]{MitLicense2012a} -- thus also into those copies you make for your own
  purposes own your own machines, and even if this is probably not so often
  reviewed.
  \item If you modify the received MIT licensed application, regardless for
  which purposes, you are simply not allowed to erase or modify existing
  copyright notes and permission notices. You may add your own modifications
  under new conditions, but the old base must survive.
\end{itemize}
