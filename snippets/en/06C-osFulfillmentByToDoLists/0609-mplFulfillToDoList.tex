\section{MPL licensed software}

Also, the Mozilla Public License clearly distinguishes the distribution in the
form of source code from that in the form of binaries: First, it allows the
\enquote{Distribution of Source Form}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
§3.1]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. Then, it specifies the conditions for a
\enquote{Distribution of Executable Form}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
§3.2]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. Additionally, the MPL confronts the
\enquote{distribution of Covered Software} with the \enquote{distribution of a
Larger Work}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3.3]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. So, taken
as whole, the MPL mainly focusses on the distribution of software. Thus, for
finding the relevant, simply processable task lists, also the following MPL
specific open source use case structure\footnote{For details of the general OSUC
finder $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\ \pageref{OsucTokens} and
\pageref{OsucDefinitionTree}} can be used:

\subsection{MPL-9: Passing a modified library as embedded binary}
\label{OSUC-10B-MPL}

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to distribute a modified version of the received
MPL licensed code snippet, module, library, or plugin to 3rd parties -- in the
form of binary files or as a binary package together with another larger
software unit which contains this code snippet, module, library, or plugin as an
embedded component.
\item[covers] OSUC-10B\footnote{For details $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\
\pageref{OSUC-10B-DEF}}
\item[requires] the tasks in order to fulfill the license conditions:
\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the licensing elements -- esp.\ all
  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
  liability -- are retained in your package in exact the form you have received
  them. If you compile the binary from the sources, ensure that all these
  licensing elements are also incorporated into the package.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Create a \emph{modification text file}, if such a
  notice file still does not exist. \emph{Expand} the \emph{modification text
  file} by a more general description of your modifications. Incorporate it into
  your distribution package.

  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Make the source code of the embedded library
  accessible via a repository under your own control: Push the source code
  package into an internet repository and enable its download function without
  requiring any fee from the downloading user. Integrate an easily to find
  description into your distribution package which explains how the code can be
  received from where. Ensure, that this repository is usable reasonably long
  enough.
  
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Insert a prominent hint to the download repository
  into your distribution and/or your additional material.

  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Execute the to-do list of use case MPL-8\footnote{
  Making the code accessible via a repository means distributing the software in
  the form of source code. Hence, you must also fulfill all tasks of the
  corresponding use case.}.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Give the recipient a copy of the MPL 2.0 license.
  If it is not already part of the software package, add it\footnote{For
  implementing the handover of files correctly $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}

The MPL offers a section \enquote{Responsibilities} which contains nearly all
requirements\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. Only for some
subordinated aspects, one has also to reflect other paragraphs\footcite[pars
pro to cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3 - concerning the trademarks]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}.
With respect to this structure, we can detect the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}

  \item In a more general attitude, the MPL states that it \enquote{[\ldots]
  does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any
  Contributor} -- except as it may be necessary \enquote{to comply with} other
  requirements of the license\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §2.3]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. The OSLiC rewrites the message as the
  interdiction to promote own services and products by and with such elements.
  
  \item The MPL also generally prescribes that \enquote{you may not remove or
  alter the substance of any license notice (including copyright notices, patent
  notices, disclaimer of warranties, or limitations of liabiliy) contained
  within the Source Code Form [\ldots]}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §3.4]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. This focussing to the \enquote{substance of any
  license notice} refers to the allowance to \enquote{[\ldots] alter any license
  notices to the extent required to remedy known factual
  innacuracies}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3.4]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}.
  Following its principle to offer one reliable way and to ignore variants of
  secondary importance, the OSLiC simplifies this condition to the general
  proscription to modify any licensing material -- namely for all use cases
  [MPL-1 - MPL-9]. But for emphasizing that this is a job which must be activily
  done, the OSLiC additionally rewrites this interdiction into all
  \emph{2others} use cases [MPL-2 - MPL-9] as the task to retain the licensing
  notices in the form one has obtained them.
  
  \item Moreover, the MPL requires for all \enquote{distributions of [the]
  source [code] form} that all modifications of the software \enquote{[\ldots]
  must be under the terms of (the MPL)} and that the distributor
  \enquote{[\ldots] must inform} all \enquote{recipients} that the software
  \enquote{[\ldots] is governed by the terms of (the MPL), and how (the
  recipients) can obtain a copy of this license}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §3.1]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. For the respective use case (MPL-2, MPL-4, MPL-6,
  MPL-8), the OSLiC rewrites these conditions so that each MPL source code
  package must mandatorily contain the MPL itself as textfile and an additional
  licensing file or statement strictly following the text given by the addendum
  of the MPL\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ Exhibit A]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. Because
  the MPL is 'only' a license with weak copyleft, the OSLiC proposes to separate
  the MPL licensed, embedded component from the overarching program (MPL-8).
  
  \item But the MPL does not explicitly require to mark all modifications.
  Nevertheless, this is state of the art in computer emgineering. Therefore,
  with respect to the cases of distributing modified source code (MPL-4, MPL-6
  and MPL-8), the OSLiC proposes to mark all modifications inside of the source
  code and to update the description of the functional changes. In case of
  distributing the modified software in the form of binaries, it should be
  sufficient, to describe the modifications only on the functional level.
  
  \item Furthermore, the MPL requires that the \enquote{Covered Software} -- in
  all cases of distributing it in an \enquote{Executable Form} (MPL-3, MPL-5,
  MPL-7, MPL-9) -- \enquote{[\ldots] must also be made available in Source Code
  Form [\ldots]} and that the distributor \enquote{[\ldots] must inform
  recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source
  Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the
  cost of distribution to the recipient}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\
  §3.2.a]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. The OSLiC rewrites these conditions as the
  obligation to offer a download service at no charge and to point towards this
  services inside of the distributed package.
  
  \item In this context, the MPL allows to distribute the binaries under terms
  of another license \enquote{[\ldots] provided that that the license for the
  Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in
  the Source Code Form under this License}\footcite[cf.][\nopage
  wp.\ §3.2.b]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. This possibility might become important for
  those cases where the license compatibility must explicitly be managed.
  Normally, it should be sufficient also to distribute the binaries under the
  MPL. Thus, in case of distributing binaries ((MPL-3, MPL-5, MPL-7, MPL-9), the
  OSLiC proposes to insert into the distribution packages the MPL itself and an
  additional licensing file or statement strictly following the text given by
  the addendum of the MPL\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ Exhibit
  A]{Mpl20OsiLicense2013a}. But again, because the MPL is 'only' a license with
  weak copyleft, the OSLiC proposes to separate the MPL licensed embedded
  component from the overarching program (MPL-9)
  
  
  \item Finally, one has clearly to state that this rule above evokes a real
  source code distribution which therefore must follow the rules of distributing
  the software. Thus, the OSLiC requires in all cases of a binary distribution
  to execute also the task-lists of the respective source code use cases.
