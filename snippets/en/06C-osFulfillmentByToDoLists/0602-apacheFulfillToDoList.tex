\section{Apache licensed software}

Today, the current release of the Apache open source license is version 2.0,
elder versions are depricated\footnote{For details $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\
\pageref{sec:ProtectPowerOfApL}}. Because it focusses primarily on the
\enquote{redistribution}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §4]{ApL20OsiLicense2004a},
the following simplified Apache specific open source use case
finder\footnote{For details of the general OSUC finder $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\
\pageref{OsucTokens} and \pageref{OsucDefinitionTree}} can be used:

\begin{description}

\item[means] that you are going to use a received Apache licensed software only
for yourself and that you do not hand it over to any 3rd party in any sense.

\item[covers] OSUC-01, OSUC-03, OSUC-06, and OSUC-09\footnote{For details 
$\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\ \pageref{OSUC-01-DEF} - \pageref{OSUC-09-DEF}}

\item[requires] no tasks in order to fulfill the conditions of the Apache 2.0
license with respect to this use case:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item You are allowed to use any kind of Apache software in any sense and in
    any context without any obligations as long as you do not give the software
    to 3rd parties.
  \end{itemize}
  
\item[prohibits] \ldots
\begin{itemize}
  \item to promote any of your services – based on the this software – by
  trademarks, service marks, or product names linked to the software except as
  required for unpartially describing the used software file.
  \item to institute any patent litigation against anyone alleging that the
  software constitutes patent infringement.

\subsection{ApL-2: Passing the unmodified software as source code}
\label{OSUC-02-Apache20} \label{OSUC-05-Apache20} \label{OSUC-07-Apache20} 

\begin{description}

\item[means] that you are going to distribute an unmodified version of the
received Apache software to 3rd parties in the form of a set of source code files or
an integrated source code package\footnote{In this case it doesn't matter
whether you  distribute a program, an application, a server, a snippet, a
module, a library, or a plugin as an independent or an embedded unit}

\item[covers] OSUC-02, OSUC-05, OSUC-07\footnote{For details $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\ 
\pageref{OSUC-02-DEF} - \pageref{OSUC-07-DEF}}

\item[requires] the following tasks in order to fulfill the license conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Give the recipient a copy of the Apache 2.0
  license. If it is not already present in the software package, add
  it\footnote{For implementing the handover of files correctly $\rightarrow$
  OSLiC, p. \pageref{DistributingFilesHint}}.
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the licensing elements -- esp.\ the
  specific copyright notice of the original author(s) -- are retained in your
  package in the form you have received them.
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that a \emph{notice text file}\footnote{
  The Apache license seems purposely to be a bit ambiguous: it uses the term
  \enquote{``Notice'' text file}. In its strict sense, the term refers to a file
  named 'NOTICE.[txt\textbar{}pdf\textbar{}\ldots]'. In a weaker sense, it may
  denote any (text) file containing (licensing) notices. For being sure to act
  according to this requirement you should also read this term in the broader
  sense if there is no text file named 'NOTICE'} is retained in your package in
  the form you have received it.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Let the documentation of your distribution and/or
  your additional material also reproduce the content of the \emph{notice text
  file}, a hint to the software name, a link to its homepage, and a link to the
  Apache 2.0 license.
\end{itemize}

\item[prohibits] \ldots
\begin{itemize}
  \item to promote any of your services or products – based on the this software
  – by trademarks, service marks, or product names linked to this Apache
  software, except as required for unpartially describing the used software and
  for reproducing the notice text file.

  software constitutes patent infringement.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ApL-3: Passing the unmodified software as binaries} 

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to distribute an unmodified version of the
received Apache software to 3rd parties in the form of a set of binary files or an
integrated bi\-na\-ry package\footnote{In this case it doesn't matter
whether you  distribute a program, an application, a server, a snippet, a
module, a library, or a plugin as an independent or an embedded unit}

  sources, ensure that all the licensing elements are also incorporated into the
  package.
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the \emph{notice text file} is
  retained or integrated into your binary package in the form you have initially
  received
  it.
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the \emph{notice text file} is also

  especially, if you are distributing an unmodified Apache licensed library as
  embedded component of your own work which displays its own copyright notice.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Let the documentation of your distribution and/or
  your additional material also reproduce the content of the \emph{notice text
  file}, a hint to the software name, a link to its homepage, and a link to the
  Apache 2.0 license -- especially as subsection of your own copyright notice.

  at least all the information of that \emph{notice text file} you have
  received.

  modifications thoroughly. Generate a \emph{notice text file}, if it still does
  not exist. \emph{Add} a description of your modifications into the

  \item to institute any patent litigation against anyone alleging that the
  software constitutes patent infringement.

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item On the one hand, the Apache 2.0 license does not permit
  \enquote{[\ldots] to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
  product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary
  use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
  NOTICE file}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §6]{ApL20OsiLicense2004a}. On the other
  hand, this license alerts that all the patent licenses – granted to those who
  \enquote{[\ldots] institute a patent litigation} – will terminate
  automatically\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3]{ApL20OsiLicense2004a}. Hence, the
  OSLiC generally (ApL-1 - ApL-9) interdicts to promote products or services by
  these elements and to legally fight against patents linked to the software.
  
  \item The ApL also requires to \enquote{[\ldots] give any other recipients of
  the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\
  §4.1]{ApL20OsiLicense2004a}. Therefore, all \emph{4others} use cases contain
  the respective mandatory condition (ApL-2 - ApL-9).
   
  \item Additionally, the ApL requires, that modifications must be
  marked\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §4.2]{ApL20OsiLicense2004a}. Thus, in all
  cases of passing the modified software in the form of source code the OSLiC
  requires to mark the modifications and to integrate a hint into the notice
  file – while in all the cases of passing the modified software in the form of
  binaries it inserts only a voluntary condition (ApL-4 - ApL-9).
  
  \item Furthermore, the ApL requires that one must \enquote{[\ldots] retain, in
  the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright,
  patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work}
  So, the OSLIC requires in all contexts (ApL-1 - ApL-9) that the licensing
  elements are retained in the form you have received them\footnote{This might
  confuse some readers: Yes, even if you distribute a modified version in the
  form of binaries you must fulfill this condition. Moreover, you must also hand
  the license over to your receipient. But, nevertheless, you are not obliged to
  publish the modified source code, too. ($\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.
  \pageref{sec:ProtectPowerOfApL})}.
  
  \item Finally, the ApL requires that the received “NOTICE text file” must be
  integrated as readable copy to each package distributed in the form of source
  code, or – in case of binary distibutions – must be displayed
  \enquote{[\ldots] if and wherever such third-party notices normally
  appear}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §4.4]{ApL20OsiLicense2004a}. Thus, the OSLiC
  requires mandatorily that all source code distributions must include the
  notice text file (ApL-2, ApL-4, ApL-6, ApL-8) and that all distributions of
  binary applications which normally show such a copyrigth screen must integrate
  the content of the notice file into this screen (ApL-5, ApL9). For libraries
  distributed in the form of binaries it is assumed that they normally do not
  contain such copyright dialogs (ApL-7)
\end{itemize}
