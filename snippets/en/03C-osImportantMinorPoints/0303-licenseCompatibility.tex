\section{Excursion: The Problem of License Compatibility}
\footnotesize
\begin{quote}\itshape
Here we discuss the often neglected or only loosely touched problem of combining
differently licensed software. We will hint to the Exclusion-List of the Free
software foundation; we will hint to the eclipse / GPL-plugin problem; we will
mention the recent discussion whether the kernel requires to license the
complete Android as GPL; and finally we will discuss the just now published, short
analysis of Jaeger and Metzger presenting a combining matrix which seems to fall
into their lap. We ourselves will argue that question can simply be answered:
only if you embed two libraries which both are licensed by an on
on-top-development protecting license and if these both license require the
licensing of the derivated work by different licenses then you have a problem.
In all other case which we will describe an list there is no problem.
